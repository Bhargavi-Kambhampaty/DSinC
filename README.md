# DSinC â€“ Data Structures in C

This repository contains my implementations and notes for core data structures using the C programming language. It's part of my learning journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and gain an in-depth understanding of how data structures work under the hood.


Each subfolder contains:

- `.c` files for implementation  
- Sample test cases (if applicable)  
- Comments explaining key logic

## Topics Covered

- Arrays (1D, 2D)
- Sorting Methods (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick, Merge)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)- Insertion and Deletion
- Stacks (Array & Linked List-based)
- Queues (Circular, Priority)

## Goals

- Practice writing clean, modular C code  
- Understand time & space complexity  
- Reinforce theory with hands-on implementation

## Tools

- Language: C  
- Compiler: `gcc`  
- OS: Ubuntu (Linux)
